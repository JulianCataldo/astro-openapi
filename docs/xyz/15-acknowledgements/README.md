**Astro OpenAPI** is leveraging Viljami Kuosmanen's awesome work, check out:

- [OpenAPI Stack Website](https://openapistack.co/)

Main goal of **Astro OpenAPI** is to promote **standards-based** API design.  
This couldn't be done without the continuous, long-standing work achieved by:

- [the OpenAPI initiative](https://www.openapis.org/)
- [the JSON Schema community](https://json-schema.org/)

I'm also looking forward to integrate this young, blooming initiative: [Async API](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/json-schema-beyond-validation).  
It is tailored for **event-based** APIs (WebSocket, Server Sent Events,â€¦), be sure to check it out. It's evolving fast.
